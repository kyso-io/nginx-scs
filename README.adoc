= Nginx docker image for Kyso Static Content Server

This container provides a nginx server prepared to serve static content
available on a directory using an auth_request_uri if passed as a parameter.

== Environment variables

- `AUTH_REQUEST_URI`: Url to use as the auth_request proxy, only used if the
  variable is set.

- `NO_AUTH_PREFIX`: If present when `AUTH_REQUEST_URI` is set the location
  referenced by this prefix does not use authentication.

- `HTML_ROOT`: if present, we use that directory as the root of the HTTP
  server.
